This repository contains the code for the paper Controllable Texture Tiling with Transformed RoPE-Enhanced Diffusion Models , accepted as a conference paper in SIGGRAPH 2026.

## Setup
The code is written in python 3.10 and uses PyTorch along with pytorch-lightning for distributed training.
Please create a new conda environment with python 3.10 and run the `setup.sh` script to install all the dependencies.

```bash
conda create -n ctile python=3.10
conda activate ctile

sh setup.sh
```

## Dataset & Pretrained Models

Our dataset can be downloaded [here](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/heika94/ctile-dataset) and be stored in `dataset` folder.

We also uploaded the baseline dataset [here](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/heika94/ctile-baseline), you can also store it in `dataset` folder.

The pretrained modelscanbe downloaded [here](https://modelscope.cn/models/heika94/control-tile/resolve/master/model-lora.ckpt) and stored in `ckpt` folder.

After running the setup script and placing the dataset and checkpoints in the correct location, the directory structure should look like this:

```
    .

    |   |-- dataset
    |   |   |-- ctile-dataset
    |   |   |   |-- metadata

## Training

```bash
# train with blender dataset
python run.py train_phase1
# train with adaptation dataset, remember to resume from phase1
python run.py train_phase2
```

## Testing

```bash
python run.py test
```
